# PassKeyp: A Password Management Application
Developed by **Group #6**: **Silvana Borgo**, **Rachel Christman**, **Daniel Gonzalez**, and **Ryan Travers**

### Description
Passkeyp is a password management app for users to maintain a list of sites with their corresponding passwords (and potentially additional information, such as username). Passkeyp protects your passwords by encrypting password files using PGP. By cryptographic or computational methods, there is no known mechanism to break PGP encryption allowing you to encrypt files in a highly secure manner.
